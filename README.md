## Introduction
Hello, I am Zpiboo (aint no wayy) and I like code.

You might've noticed, when seeing my profile picture, that I like CSS (which, sorry for those who didn't know and thought they were cool programmers, isn't a programming language. no, it's not cool either.). It (sadly) occupies most of my time (i cant help it this shit is addictive), after sleep (12h+ per night or zombie).

But, since I am a really cool person, I have cool occupations too: Minecraft (aka the coolest game ever). Or, to be precise, Minecraft parkour. I was told about the coolest Minecraft parkour server, OmegaParkour (closed bc an admin got scammed :( ), by the coolest non-me person in the world: TSOLO88 (why did i talk about him? uhh... idk).

oh and in my spare time i go to school (im 17)

## Projects
"Projects"? What's a "project"? Some kind of sandwich?

_TODO: Finish that (idk)_
